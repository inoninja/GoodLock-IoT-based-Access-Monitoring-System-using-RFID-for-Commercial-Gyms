Project Title: GoodLock: IoT-based Access Monitoring System using RFID for Commercial Gyms

Description: This project proposes an automated access control solution designed to streamline modern gym operations. By integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology with a centralized web management system, the device ensures secure and seamless facility access. The system eliminates manual front-desk checks by linking physical entry directly to a member's real-time subscription status, effectively preventing unauthorized access and automating membership enforcement.

Features:
Contactless Entry: Quick and hygienic access using passive RFID keyfobs.
Real-Time Subscription Sync: Access is automatically granted or denied based on the current payment status in the database.
Centralized Web Dashboard: Administrators can register new members, assign keyfobs, and monitor entry logs remotely.
Scalable Architecture: Capable of handling multiple entry points and a growing user base without hardware upgrades.
Automated Security: Prevents "tailgating" or entry by non-members, reducing revenue loss.

Installation Instructions: Instructions on how to clone and run the app locally (for others or future you).

Setup: Instructions for setting up IoT devices and cloud services.
